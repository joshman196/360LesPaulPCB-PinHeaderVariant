# Xbox 360 Les Paul Neck Connection PCBs with Pin Headers
PCBs for the GH3 Les Pauls that uses pin headers instead of the pogo pins. Only tested for the Xbox 360 variant.

This is meant to hopefully be more resilient and last longer compared to the flawed pogo pin design of the original. I have successfully been using these PCBs in my personal 360 Les Paul for nearly a year with no issues as of writing this (February 2026, PCBs were finished in March 2025). I just never published this publicly until now.

It doesn't matter which side has the male or female ends of the pin headers, but if it matters to you what I did, I put the female end on the neck side and the male end on the body side.

## Parts Needed
- Two 2x4 sets of pin headers—at least one male and one female—with a pitch of 2.54mm
  - You can order male headers [here](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256801306868805.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.6.a565QzDsQzDsx1&algo_pvid=47e441ae-2408-44e4-844d-918edf4d3a9c&algo_exp_id=47e441ae-2408-44e4-844d-918edf4d3a9c-5&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22339%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22fromPage%22%3A%22search%22%7D&pdp_npi=6%40dis%21USD%212.09%210.99%21%21%212.09%210.99%21%4021033d9d17708663915845857eeb73%2112000016335036022%21sea%21US%210%21ABX%211%210%21n_tag%3A-29910%3Bd%3A4b3f2a38%3Bm03_new_user%3A-29895%3BpisId%3A5000000197847450&curPageLogUid=xxjkoAe5MqHI&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A%7Cx_object_id%3A1005001493183557%7C_p_origin_prod%3A) and female headers [here.](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256803911413457.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.6.7198cEHycEHyal&algo_pvid=1320cc7a-59dc-466f-82f1-05ed10a3e804&algo_exp_id=1320cc7a-59dc-466f-82f1-05ed10a3e804-5&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22597%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22fromPage%22%3A%22search%22%7D&pdp_npi=6%40dis%21USD%213.58%210.99%21%21%213.58%210.99%21%4021033d9d17708658461914484eeb6a%2112000028025434752%21sea%21US%210%21ABX%211%210%21n_tag%3A-29910%3Bd%3A4b3f2a38%3Bm03_new_user%3A-29895%3BpisId%3A5000000197847491&curPageLogUid=PdNK9EIaoCrH&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A%7Cx_object_id%3A1005004097728209%7C_p_origin_prod%3A) **REMEMBER TO SELECT 2X4**
    - If these links die, just search up something like "2.54mm 2x4 pin headers" on aliexpress, both male and female sets
   
**REMEMBER TO SET PCB THICKNESS TO 1.2MM WHEN ORDERING**
